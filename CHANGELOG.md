# Changelog

All notable changes to nebu are documented here. For full release artifacts, see [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/withObsrvr/nebu/releases).

## v0.6.3

- Fixed `_nebu_version` in event envelopes for processors installed via `go install`.
- Pinned all reference processors to `github.com/withObsrvr/nebu v0.6.2`, so runtime build-info fallback now reports the real version instead of `dev`.
- No other code changes in this release.

## v0.6.2

- Unblocked `go install` for in-tree processors.
- `nebu --version` now reads runtime build info when ldflags are absent.
- `nebu install` now includes captured `go install` output in failures.
- Fixed `usdc-filter` to read the correct `transfer.assetCode` field.
- Added Claude Code skill docs and worked pipeline examples.

## v0.6.0

- Added runtime hooks via `Runtime.Use(Hooks{...})`.
- Added deterministic fatal-priority preemption.
- Added CI enforcement for stable API snapshots.

## v0.5.0

- Declared the stable contract surface: `pkg/processor`, `pkg/source`, `registry.yaml` v1, and `--describe-json`.
- Formalized transform and sink interfaces.
- Split `pkg/source` into a dep-free interface package with concrete implementations elsewhere.
- Added the registry specification.
